# Manual Fix Crashed Worlds

With this mod you can manually set your skillpoints, death, zombiekills, expierence and level.

The following console command are added by this mod:

    setlevel [level]
    setskillpoints [skillpoints]
    setexp [experience]
    setdeaths [no. of deaths]
    setzombiekills [no. of zombiekills]

Warning: Use With Care!

This was only tested with a singleplayer world, but it should work on dedicated servers if executed on the client. (since v0.0.0.2)
The commands require a permission level of 0. (admin)

I created this mod for setting up my player level, deaths, skillpoints, etc. after Iâ€™ve lost my singleplayer world because of a crash. I recovered my lost items, books, etc. via creative menu (cm).
